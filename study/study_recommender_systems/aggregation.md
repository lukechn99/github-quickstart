### How do we order and summarize a whole bunch of ratings?
We can base on...  
Average (count)  
Average (count rate)  
Recent average (time-decayed)  
Percentage above a threshold (like simplifying 5* -> thumbs up/thumbs down)  

### Damped mean
Adds k number of the average rating into the data set to pull the new mean closer to the mean
