### How to find ratings and preferences
Implicitly: what you click on, what you buy, put in cart, view, search, duration of interaction  
Explicit ratings  
Context and characteristics: location, demographic, season, weather  

With implicit ratings, we need to be careful of interpreting things wrong  

### General Things to Know About Ratings
Higher effort -> lower participation
Lower effort -> less information  

Sometimes higher effort and more information is actually not helpful. A 10 point scale wasn't necessarily better than a 5 point scale and a 5 point scale wasn't much better than just thumbs up and thumbs down.  
Socially speaking, everything below a 4* is perceived as negative now. We can try to avoid this by using a user's previous ratings to average it out and get a baseline for what the user typically does. We could also use something instead of stars (never again, would avoid, meh, enjoyed it, 10/10) so that people are not anchored to a point rating that they might have a bad baseline for.
