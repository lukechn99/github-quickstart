### Rationale

We want to have an explanation for...  
high stakes recommendations like drugs, when we want to foster trust, to allow for feedback and user tweaking, to give the user self-awareness  
Explanations are sometimes more suitable for some recommenders more than others. For example, with a content based recommender, you want to probably explain the attributes you based your recommendation off of. However, for a UUCF recommender, it might be less necessary than just to say "you might like this"  

### How to Explain
You can literally explain the prediction/rating with a general explanation of the process (complex systems, content based filtering, are harder to explain), or specific to the recommendation by revealing the data (IICF is good for this).  
You can explain the corroborating evidence (confidence scores, state the strength of the data, talk about the strengths of the recommendation)  
We never knew whether or not the explanations were actually helpful  
It's been found that corroborating evidence plus very light explanation works best. 

### Questions
Has there been any research done on how explanations affect the user's perception of the overall reliability of items and overall reliability of the site? How could this be measured? Yes. Having explanations is good, generally. Too much complication undermines trust.  
How could you measure whether the user sees the site as reliable or not? Adding 2/3 star of noise will undermine trust. Typically measured through surveys, explain that the version they're using is a test system and ask if they would recommend the test system. You can also ask them if they would recommend the regular system before (however, it's been discovered that users are likely to trust the old system even less after experiencing the new system and having their trust undermined)  
I don't think my thesis would actually work because discouraging usage of the site by including noise doesn't really decrease their consumption of movies.
