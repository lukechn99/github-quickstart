### Rationale

We want to have an explanation for...  
high stakes recommendations like drugs, when we want to foster trust, to allow for feedback and user tweaking, to give the user self-awareness  
Explanations are sometimes more suitable for some recommenders more than others. For example, with a content based recommender, you want to probably explain the attributes you based your recommendation off of. However, for a UUCF recommender, it might be less necessary than just to say "you might like this"  

### How to Explain
You can literally explain the prediction/rating with a general explanation of the process (complex systems, content based filtering, are harder to explain), or specific to the recommendation by revealing the data (IICF is good for this).  
You can explain the corroborating evidence (confidence scores, state the strength of the data, talk about the strengths of the recommendation)  
We never knew whether or not the explanations were actually helpful  
It's been found that corroborating evidence plus very light explanation works best.
