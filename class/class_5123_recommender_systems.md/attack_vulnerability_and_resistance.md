# Attack Vulnerability and Resistance
Recommenders don't work when people have incentive to lie.  
There is business incentive to attack recommender systems to inflate scores.  
Nuke attacks downgrade items even when you would probably like it.  
Or there could be attacks on the system itself to make it function poorly.  

### Nuke attack
Bad ratings that destroy the scores. 

### Push attack
Good ratings that inflate the scores.  
In UUCF, you could create a bunch of fake users that take on the public ratings of the most popular items and then inject your fake product rating into those fake users. These fake users could get into the neighborhoods of as many users. 

### Detection
Look for anomalies (location discrepancies, clustered ratings, sudden changes), look at the user's history, weight users' ratings based on how established their profile is.  

How do we numerically detect? Defend at the API level? And overall ensure it is not successful?  
We should look for unusual patterns of ratings (over a target item or overall), unusual pattern of accounts (creation rate or activity), unusual changes in the results (top-k, predicted values). We can prevent by limiting the ratings that can be made, downgrading newer ratings, reCaptcha (I'm not a computer), email verification for account creation, phone number verification, require a written review, verification of consumption.  
*We could given incentives for reviewers, but this could create biases.*  

### Robustness in algorithms
Neighborhood based algorithms (item or user) have lots of points of attack. Item-based is more robust because it's easier to inject user profiles. 

# Attack Vulnerability & Resistance
- Most Common Attack: Having and otherwise unpopular Product be rated highly / frequently as if it were
- Other Attacks:
	- Nuke Attacks: Review bombing of a product to drive negative press for malicious reasons
	- Making Systems Run Poorly

#### How to track
```
1. Traffic Analysis			3. Frequency
2. Text (Review) Analysis	4. Temporal & Spatial Data
```

##### User Based Collaborative Filtering
**How would you push an item (popularity)** -> make a lot of varied accounts representative of the population and rate item _X_ very highly.
+ Rate Popular / Unpopular items accordingly w/ variance to make impact on neighborhood
+ Alternative: Rate Popular Items High and everything else random

### Defending the System
+ Detect and Attack
	+ Unusual patterns of rating (over target item _or_ overall)
	+ Unusual patterns of account creation or account activity levels
	+ Unusual changes in top-k / pred values
+  Preventing Attacks
	+  Requite authentication for account creation / Sign in 
		+  Captcha, Phone Number, Dual Factor
	+  Limit contribution based on metric 
		+  How long an account has been active
+  Making Attacks not Matter
	+  Neighborhood Models are more susceptible to attack in general
	+  Hybrid algorithms provide similar accuracy to collaborative filtering algorithms with the added bonus of making attacks harder to do
