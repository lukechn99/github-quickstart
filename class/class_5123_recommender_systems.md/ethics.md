What responsibility do we have when making recommenders that serve underrepresented groups?  
Do we have an objective suitability criteria? What do we do with content that is harmful to some or all people? Recommending methods of suicide is one thing, but what about alcohol? It might be good or it might be harmful to an alcoholic. 

### Retail (amazon)
Targeting children, racial or demographic bias, self destructive or addicting items, feeding compulsive shopping, hiding cheaper and better options, honest representation. 

### News (google, yahoo)
Obligation to recommend based on truthfulness, revealing personally identifying information, promoting an agenda, is a diversity reasonable?  

### Multimedia (instagram, netflix)
Inapproporiate content, showing/encouraging self-harm, ability to show diverse content, censorship, collection of data, ethical filter

### Philosophical views
Mill, Bentham  
Utilitarianism, there is no absolute right. Two wrongs can make a right. Maximize utility

Kant  
Deontological ethics, actions are right or wrong inherently, "God-given", there are certain rights that people have (e.g. freedoms). Two wrongs don't make a right.  

Aristotle  
Virtue ethics focuses on the practitioner

Rauls  
Veil of ignorance, you ask a question while considering everyone both winner and loser  

### Considerations
Is it okay to recommend Asian clothes to Hmong just because we don't have much data on Hmong? How about offer black products to Jamaicans?
