should robots have autonomy to kill?  

### History
First coining of the term "AI" was in 1955. It proposed that every aspect of intelligence can be precisely represented by machine.

### Basics
An agent has perceptions and actions and can be judged based on performance metrics.  
most problems can be simplified into a graph with many states as nodes. With this simplification, solving a problem becomes traversing a graph and now we just need graph algorithms, information like directed vs undirected, cyclical vs acyclic, etc.
