### Rules of Inference (Modus Ponens)
Soundness (apply rule of inference all possible ways) and completeness (everything that can be derived with the rule of inference )  

A entails B iff every model in which A is true, B is also true. Because A is a subset of B.  
A rule is complete is every entailed sentence can be generated by the rule.  
Modus Ponens is not complete. 
Modus Ponens is sound.  

A -> B

### Resolution (a rule of inference)
Rewrite in conjunctive normal form to resolve because it is consistent with the truth tables.   
Deduction theorem: A entails B iff A -> B is valid, which means notA v B is valid, which means not(notA v B) is unsatisfiable, and A ^ notB is unsatisfiable.  
How to do it?
1. Eliminate <=>
2. Eliminate =>
3. Move negations in front of literals
4. rewrite as conjunctions of disjunctions A v (B ^ C) -> (A v B) ^ (A v C)
