look at aircargo problem in textbook

Search: state space representation for representation and search algorithms for reasoning

Logic: logic for representation and resolution for reasoning

Planning: action schema for representation and forward/backward search for reasoning

Resolution (will be predicate calculus), planning (representation, how do you write schemas), semantics (knowledge graphs, ontologies)
How did we do forward search or chaining and backward search? Study this because I have no idea. 

Study plan: look through slides
then textbook

Every variable must be quantified, the safest place to put it is at the beginning
