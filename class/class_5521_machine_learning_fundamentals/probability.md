### Frequency
after many repeats of event E, what value does it approach?

### Degree of Belief
The degree of belief in a certain occurence of an event

### Law of Total Probability
With mutually exclusive events 

### Bayes Theorem
P(A|B) = P(B and A) / P(B)

### Random Variables
Map events to real numbers  
Probability distribution function is a derivative of the cumulative distribution function

### Expectation
Summation for discrete X and integral for continuous X.  
Covariance indicates the relationship between two random variables  

### Probability Distributions
Bernoulli, binomial, multinomial, uniform, gaussian (univariate, multivariate), point estimate, maximum aposteriori (MAP), bayesian estimate, read Bishop ch. 2
* Point estimate tries to find a single parameter with the most likelihood of replicating X
* Bernoulli is one trial as opposed to binomial which is N trials of bernoulli
