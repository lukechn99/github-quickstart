### Matrices
Quick tips:  
* *i* denotes row, *j* denotes column
* *A* is symmetric if *A<sup>T</sup>* = *A*
* Order of multiplying does not matter for three matrices *A(BC)* = *(AB)C*
* Multiplication is distributive
* Multiplication is not commutative *AB* != *BA*
* Column rank is the largest subset of columns of *A* which form a linearly independent set
* Row rank is the subset of rows
* Row rank = column rank = rank
    * Rank(A) = rank(AT)
    * 
* Full rank square matrices have an inverse *A<sup>-1</sup>*
* *Ax* = *b* is solvable when A is invertible
* Gradients
