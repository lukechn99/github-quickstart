### constructors
publicly available functions to create an instance of the class object

### design patterns
we will use the facade pattern while going through project iterations

### classes versus structs
classes default to private and structs default to public
encapsulation hides implementation details, does not allow developer to directly access information

### 
Java is passed by value
All primitives can be passed by reference in C++ with "&"

```
int fun(int &x, double f);
int able = fun(3, 4); 

// does not work because first parameter must be a variable
```

runtime binding vs compiler binding? 
polymorphism and inheritance?
virtual methods
