# Cohesion
when looking at software design, we want HIGH cohesion, everything should work towards one goal
functional cohesion is where each function does a single task, but together coordinate to do more, classes should also have functional cohesion  
sequential cohesion outputs information that is then input into another  
communcational cohesion is where two elements operate on the same input data and contribute towards output  
procedural cohesion is ensuring the order of execution  
temporal cohesion is where all elements are related temporally  
logical cohesion is where the code is related logically but not functionally, code can look very different for one function that read from the cloud versus one that reads from disk  
coincidental cohesion, elements are not related, no conceptual relations

# Coupling
should be LOOSELY coupled
