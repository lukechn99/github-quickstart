# Project Description and Overview
Incorporate 3D maps, physics, logistics, route planning, malfunctions, security, congestion, and cost.  
Iteration 2 - Development: In the development phase, we build the actual system to
make it work and be useful.
### Project Timeline:
Dates & Deadlines Item Description
11/9/2020 First Deliverable: Peer Reviews Provide feedback for your teammates on their iteration 1 design document.
11/17/2020 & 11/19/2020 Automated Assessment We will run our extended tests once on each codebase. This will help you fix any issues you might have with our grading scripts.

# Background
### 2.1 The Planet X Drone Fleet
We have different types of drones and want to build the best delivery system based on their constraints, strengths, and weaknesses. In other words we are no longer working with simple drones. Besides understanding how these drones work, it is important for us to start working with real
street and topology data so that we can simulate existing environments. This is detailed below in section 2.2. Finally, we need sophisticated algorithms to accomplish efficient drone delivery based on real data.
