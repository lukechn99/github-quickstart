# Software Engineering
SDLC:  
Specification, what the system does  
Design and Implementation, organization of the system and implementing it  
Validation, does it do what the customer wants  
Evolution, change the system in response to changing customer needs  

SOLID:
Single-responsibility principle: don't bundle code that's doing different things together  
Open-close principle: open to use, closed to change  
Liskov substitution principle: accept polymorphism, if a method accepts a "student" object, it should also accept the hypothetical parent "person" object  
Interface segregation principle: favor specialized interfaces over a general one  
Dependency inversion principle: favor abstraction dependencies over concrete ones  

KISS:
Keep it simple

DRY:
Don't repeat yourself, consolidate repeated code, use inheritance and composition
