# Agile Scrum
Values Individuals and interactions over processes and tools  
Working software over comprehensive documentation  
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation  
Responding to change over following a plan  
Waterfall invites failure because it forces us to make the most important design decisions at the beginning which is also when we happen to know the least  

### Sprints
Instead of stages, we split a project into sprints. During each sprint we do analysis, design, implementation, and planning. Every sprint builds some small shippable portion of the product. We organize everyone in one cross-functional team. We do continuous design throughout the sprint to avoid technical debt. 

### Roles
Product owner is responsible for ROI and requirements and is focused on the *what* rather than the *how*.  
Scrum development team is a cross-functional group of developers, analysts, etc. They will do retrospectives and learn together. There is no imposed hierarchy, but rather it occurs naturally. A team of 9 or less people is ideal for self organization. They interact best in the same room.  
Scrum master has no management authority, rather they are a facilitator. They will help remove impediments and provide visibility. 

### Artifacts
Product backlog is the list of everything we might ever do sorted by priority written as a story or a use case.  
Sprint backlog is what we commit to doing right now and details the what and how of what should be accomplished this sprint.  

### Meetings
A sprint begins with a sprint planning meeting where we move items from product backlog to sprint backlog. Daily scrum meetings are held throughout the sprint where we report to each other what we have been working on and what we are going to work on as well as what your roadblocks are. Sprint review meetings are done at the end of the sprint to show stakeholders what was finished; this gives a chance for new requirements to be declared. The retrospective is to examine what went well and what can be improved. Finally, there are backlog refinement meetings where the team and product owner.
