# Agile Software Development
Also called rapid development is now the standard among companies and radically reduces the time needed for development.  
One great thing is that there is no hierarchy in agile. This also makes some people uncomfortable because it means they don't know their place with regards to others.  
Agile is nice because it allows you to discard things when not needed.  

### User stories vs PBI
User stories are about the persona. It allows us to focus on the user. PBI's need the task and the estimated effort that it needs. But a user story is a dynamic narrative that is created collaboratively with the user. From that, PBIs are extracted and prioritized by the product owner.  
Persona's should state what they want and why they want it. There should be no ambiguity; if any of those questions are not understood, then you should work with the user to rewrite the story. We break down the user story into epics which are overarching goals.  
Only once the epic has been created to be finished within a sprint and everyone agrees on the acceptance criteria/definition of done. A detailed story will need 3-5 acceptance criteria.  
While some PBI stories come from the user stories, others can just be non-functional requirements that you come up with or dependencies that are separate and do not come from users.
