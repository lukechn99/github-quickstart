# Agile SWE
Also called rapid development is now the standard among companies and radically reduces the time needed for development.  
One great thing is that there is no hierarchy in agile. This also makes some people uncomfortable because it means they don't know their place with regards to others.  
Agile is nice because it allows you to discard things when not needed.
