# Insertion Sort
- a sorted version of a sequence is just a permutation of it
- arrays of size 1 or 0 are always sorted
- in **insertion sort** the array is treated as two sections: sorted and unsorted
- insertion sort sorts **in place**, meaning it does not use extra space or make another array for sorting
