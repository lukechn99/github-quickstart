# Waterfall
Is good for systems that don't or can't change as much. Many times, there are for projects where extensive research and preparation was needed or changes are not anticipated. 
  
|Requirements definition| -> |System and software design| -> |Implementation and unit testing| -> |Integration and System Testing| -> |Maintenance and operation|  
At the maintenance and operation step, you can jump back up to any other step and flow back down.
