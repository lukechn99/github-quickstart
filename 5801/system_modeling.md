# Systems
Use UML to plan the system. We have to consider many things outside of the code:  
External perspective - where you model the context or environment  

*models should be **complete** and **correct***

### UML Diagram Types
Activity diagrams show the activities going on, especially for data and what's happening to it and where it's going  
Use case diagrams show the interactions ebtween a system and its environment  
Sequence diagrams show interactions between the system, system components, and actors  
Class diagrams show the classes and objects  
State diagrams  

*most companies do not follow hardcore agile rules; instead, they will tailor it to their company... or laziness*
