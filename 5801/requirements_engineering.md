# Requirements Engineering
Notations are important. English language itself is not structured and discrete enough to express design. 

### IEEE Software Requirements
The I triple E is a set of standards for Software Requirements Specifications  
We consider **Functional** constraints as the abilities that the service needs such as a login, a search bar, or other specific use case. 
It is usually pertaining more towards the user than the system. We need *form based specifications* to specify functional requirements. 
Some of these include a description of the function or entity being specified, a description of inputs and their origin, outputs and their destination, 
a description of the action to be taken, for functions use a precondition to guarantee a postcondition, preparation for the side-effects
and  **Non-functional** constrainsts that apply to the *whole* system. Some metrics for non-functional requirements are speed, size, ease of use, 
reliability, robustness, and portability. 
**User requirements** and **System requirements**
