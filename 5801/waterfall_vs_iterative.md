### Waterfall
Is good for systems that don't or can't change as much. Many times, there are for projects where extensive research and preparation was needed or changes are not anticipated. 
  
|Requirements definition| -> |System and software design| -> |Implementation and unit testing| -> |Integration and System Testing| -> |Maintenance and operation|  
At the maintenance and operation step, you can jump back up to any other step and flow back down.  

### Incremental Development
Concurrently, we will do specification, development, and validation. These will produce an initial version, intermediate versions, and a final version, all the while getting feedback along the way.  

Rollout happens once the process finishes for waterfall, iterative is constantly producing small chunks of production-ready code. 
The waterfall methodology is slow-moving and needs a full cycle before being able to accommodate for new needs.  
Iterative approach is more responsive to the customer. This means cost reduction because of the efficient use of time and 
serving a product that the customer wants. It's easier to get feedback. 
Constant change in iterative means structural degradation of code, to remedy this we need refactoring. They will need a stable framework or architecture so that multiple teams can work together.  


### Integration and Configuration
The standard in software development is to "buy the wheel" no one will create their own database. This means that many people will be working on integration and configuration.  
This works with both waterfall and agile scrum.  
|Requirements| -> |Software discovery and eval| -> |Requirements refinement| -> |Application system configuration| -> |Component adaptation and integration|
