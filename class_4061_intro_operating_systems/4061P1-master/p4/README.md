# Project 4
In Project 3, we built a multi-threaded web server using POSIX threads and synchronization mechanisms. While doing so, several utility functions were provided which helped you implement the network communication portion of the web server. In this project, you will be implementing the networking utility functions using POSIX socket programming.

Project template and description PDF are present in the p4.zip (Files > Projects > P4 > p4.zip)

You should submit two times for Project 4. Please find the details in the write-up.
