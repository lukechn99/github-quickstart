# Recommender Systems
Recommender systems are an automation of the agents and personal assistants that were previously used (personal shoppers, travel agents). It started as research for video recommenders in the 1990s. Recommender systems were integrated into industry with Amazon and others. It was also a part of the tech bubble and the tech burst. There are potential applications of recommendation systems in CV, AI, ML, but especially in CV and maybe VR/AR. Matrix factorization, Top-N algorithms are used. Magic barrier: you can't recommend better than a person could rate in the first place, the value of a recommendation where we consider if the recommendation even contributes anything useful. Temporal questions matter a lot, seasonal recommendations, sequential recommendations, educational module sequences, etc. It is also hard to recommend highly personal things like which surgeon to use. To address these, we almost always need higher knowledge.  
It is a combination of ML, data mining, business, HCI

### General Model
Users will contribute *user experience*, which is added to the big data pool that's being gathered, and a recommendation, based on the many others who have their data in the pool will be considered and a recommendation is given back to the user. 

### Approaches
Recommendations can be personal or generatized to a population.  
Product association is where products are linked by users who rate them.  
Content-based figures out a profile for what you like.  
Collaborative uses opinions of the community to figure out what else you might like.

Rating : is an expression of preference that can be given explicitly (rating an item) or implicitly (through behavior cues)  
Prediction : estimation of preference  
Recommendation : selected items for the user  
Content : attributes or description of the item (text, title, reviews, tags, etc.)  
Collaborative : who likes this item, what else do those people like? Expanding the recommender system to beyond just one user
