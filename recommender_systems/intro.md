# Recommender Systems

### General Model
Users will contribute *user experience*, which is added to the big data pool that's being gathered, and a recommendation, based on the many others who have their data in the pool will be considered and a recommendation is given back to the user. 

### Approaches
Recommendations can be personal or generatized to a population.  
Product association is where products are linked by users who rate them.  
Content-based figures out a profile for what you like.  
Collaborative uses opinions of the community to figure out what else you might like.

Rating : is an expression of preference that can be given explicitly (rating an item) or implicitly (through behavior cues)  
Prediction : estimation of preference  
Recommendation : selected items for the user  
Content : attributes or description of the item (text, title, reviews, tags, etc.)  
Collaborative : who likes this item, what else do those people like? Expanding the recommender system to beyond just one user
