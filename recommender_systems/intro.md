# Recommender Systems

---
Rating : is an expression of preference that can be given explicitly (rating an item) or implicitly (through behavior cues)  
Prediction : estimation of preference  
Recommendation : selected items for the user  
Content : attributes or description of the item (text, title, reviews, tags, etc.)  
Collaborative : who likes this item, what else do those people like? Expanding the recommender system to beyond just one user
