* Use categorical ratings to speed up model building
* This method is better than individual ratings much in the same way that a binary search might be better than a linear search; linear search means 1-to-1 correspondence between effort and results whereas a binary search would have a ratio of 1-to-half of what's left. Two searches in, you'd be left with only 1/4 of the dataset. 
* Key word here is clustering algorithms
