May - Sept idea and proposal
Jan finish research and start writing
March finish writing

MovieLens:
research based, incidental development, basic science research
interactive based
analytical projects based on current data, could be applications of algorithms

Ideas:
Personalized top lists, new lists, trending, etc.
What a hypothesis of what this model would do?

Problems:  
New ranking algorithm that is not one dimensional
How do we get input for this system? What implicit inputs can be leveraged, which explicit ones need to be asked for
Sentiment analysis of critics for "good acting" "good action"?
Multi-dimensional using zoom-ins  
How can we decrease bias and balance reliability with risk? We don't want to recommend Star Wars to someone who has already watched it. 

Games and fun
"favorite film with a car crash"
MAximize user happiness and satisfaction with the system

Provide valuable insight that would make them use more

We ignore lots of information that would give a good idea of someone's taste because it locks them in to certain stereotypes. Become less precise to become more useful

Balance between new and safe. Inspire trust while giving new delights

Todo:
Read up on GroupLens papers 8+ pages, find interesting ones
Recent papers published on recommender systems (ACM rec sys conference)
Keep notes of the synopsis, their research question, what I like/don't like
Read 10 - 12

Implementation:
through the MovieLens platform
