Can we just take average ratings? Just because McDonalds get the most people, it may also get a higher score, but is it really good?  
When Amazon shows us the customer reviews, it shows the average and a distribution.  
In many cases averages can be misleading because of intensity and number of ratings.  
Normalization of user scores can be helpful when peoples' standards are different, your 4* average might be my 2* average.  
The example of Zagat and its dilution of scores over time shows that there are elements at play that are unforeseeable. People who rated mediocre restaurants badly may not go back and so there are no more bad ratings. Standards change
