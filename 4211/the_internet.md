# The Internet
Mobile network, global ISP, home network, regional ISP, institutional network. The internet is a network of *different* networks  

### A service view of the internet
Infrastructure that provides services to applications include Web, email, games, e-commerce, VoIP, and social nets

### Building blocks of the internet
Nodes: nodes include hosts (servers, PCs, laptops, phones, smart devices, etc.) and switches (routers, switches)  
Links: coax cable, optical fiber, wireless. These include point to point where the link is between two parties, or it can be multiple access 
and accessible by many different parties. Multiple access risks collisions so there has to be protocols to avoid
Everything has an address

### Physical media
Twisted Pair (TP): two copper wires twisted together and can go from 10 Mbps (category 3 phone wire) to 100Mbps (category 5 ethernet). It has to be connected to your home and run 
there directly to serve your home. 
Fiber Glass: also has to be connected to your home, not as popular  
Radio Links: These include microwave (needing a relay station and is directional), LAN, wide-area (cellular), and satellite. Satellite has a long end-to-end delay

### Issues in Networks
Efficient switching to share resources among multiple users (sharing and multiplexing)
Routing and forwarding: determines how to guide a packet from one place to another, decide which switches to use and where to switch
Packet switching: we deliver in a packet stream (like a movie being streamed instead of all in one chunk)  

We do store and then forward for packet switching  
It used to be that you have to buy routers and switches from Cisco, today both switches and routers are white boxes with software put together by yourself. 
Cisco used to bundle the software and hardware for a markup, now, Cisco and IBM are in trouble because we can buy the hardware and bundle our own software.
