# Networks vs Internet
Different networks use different protocols, so typically, networks cannot communicate with each other. 
Aside from protocols, different networks also use different transceivers that recognize 0s and 1s. 
Protocols typically use headers to store essential information. 

### Ethernet switches
Switches connect multiple devices, physically connecting n devices to n outputs. Different networks have different switches. 
Networks can be physically ocnnected or not physically connected (like satellite). Similar to a router (internet) which directs 
internet traffic.  
Older telephone systems used **circuit switching**. The path from one telephone to another is reserved just for that connection. 
Today most telephones go through the internet, they use **packet switching**. In packet switching, the switch buffers the data 
until the whole packet arrives. In packet switching, the connection is not reserved.
