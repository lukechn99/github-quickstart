# Internet Structure
National and Tier 1 ISP, Regional ISP, and Local ISP are some of the commercial levels. Tier 1 ISPs interconnect privately.  
Point-ofpresences (POP) use peering to look at what tier two service providers are connected. Peering lets traffic be more optimized so that data can go through from one service provider to another service provider. If you are a tier 1 service provider and I am one as well, and we both have customers who want to talk to each other then we want to transfer the data from my network to your network through a peering point as fast as possible. This is done by the border gateway router. Peering points are coming off of IXPs which are Internet Exchange Points
