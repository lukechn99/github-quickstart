# Transport Layer (TCP and UDP)
UPD sends out packet by packet with eah packet not following necessarily the same paht.  
TCP first sets up a path before sending data out.  

Hosts have 5 layers, but the nodes and the network runs on 3 layers for routing. This means that applications (application layer) runs on hosts and not the network.
